                    No Filter: The Inside Story of Instagram</a>, the book describe how the application shaped our life and how perfect its design is.
                    Every major corporation although has its own way to create UI and UX, as an iOS Developer Student I wanted to rework instagram using Apple's style and guidelines.
                    This clone has no backend and it was a case study to learn about UX, UI and read a great book. <br>
                
                    If you're into tech check the book it was suggested to me by a great UX designer and mentor Giselle Katics. <br>

                    This is my website, it is inspired by the famous movie the Matrix. Although, this is my first website
                    I made it from scratch with no template. Because no template has been used the website lacks of some of the basic of a good UI
                    so somewhere in the website margins are not perfect. <br>
                    This is the original page with the specifics of this website and its history <a href="originalwebsite.html" style="color: #0f0;">CLICK_HERE</a>, it is still not optimized for mobile.
