        <h1>Why iGram?</h1>

        <h2>
            The main issue with social media is that once you tap on their icon, you are immediately immersed in the platform.
            The design is intentionally crafted to captivate your attention and generate revenue. <br>
            TikTok is an example of a social media platform that excels in this regard.
            If Instagram were a default app on iOS (fortunately, it isn't), we would likely see a predominant white color scheme,
            accompanied by shades of blue and other system colors in the user interface. <br>
            There would be no iGram logo within the app. Instead, the interface would feature a clean design with a combination of gray and white,
            enhanced by subtle shadows to provide depth. The navigation would replace the home button with a "feed" button.
